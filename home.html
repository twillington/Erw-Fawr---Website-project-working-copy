			<h1>What is Erw Fawr?</h1>
			<p>Ewr Fawr is an independent outdoor pursuits club based in Coventry; the club owns an accommodation facility in North Wales which 
			is rentable for members.</p>
			<h2> A Brief History of the club </h2>
			<p>The Club was founded in 1970 by employees of the Standard Motor Company. The Club then became known as "The Standard 
			Triumph Rambling Club" and an advert was placed in a North Wales newspaper requesting the use of remote cottage as a base for walking 
			expeditions. A Major Roach answered the advert and offered the use of a former farm workers cottage which was built on land reclaimed 
			from the sea more than 150 years ago. Following the death of Major Roach in 1991 the Club purchased the property. At the time of 
			purchase the club changed the name to Erw Fawr Rambling Club, Erw Fawr being the name of the cottage, Since then the name has changed 
			to "Erw Fawr Outdoor Pursuits Club" The cottage is now used for many outdoor activities.</p>
